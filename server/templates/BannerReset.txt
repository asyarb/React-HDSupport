Hello,

I've reset your Banner password. Banner can be accessed at https://banner.sis.hawaii.edu.

Your Banner ID (username) is: FIRST
Your reset password is: change-2-day

**Please change your Banner password as soon as possible.**

To login and change your Banner password:

1. Go to https://banner.sis.hawaii.edu.

2. In the "Username" box type: FIRST
   In the "Password" box type: change-2-day
   Leave the Database box blank.
   Click on **Connect**

3. You will be told your password is expired. This is normal. Click on OK.

4. At the next screen, in the "Old Password" box, type the reset password (listed above), NOT the password you used to use.

5. In the "New Password" and "Retype new Password" boxes, please type a new password of your choice. (Please see the criteria for a new password below.)

6. Click OK.

Your new password must meet these criteria:
